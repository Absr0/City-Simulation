# City-Simulation
This project is a small city simulation built using Python and the cs1graphics library.
It includes animated cars, a moving helicopter, traffic lights, roads, buildings, a stadium, and a house.
The goal of this project was to practice graphics, animation, and basic object-oriented concepts.

**Features**
- Animated cars moving on the road
- Traffic lights that switch between red and green
- Helicopter animation moving smoothly across the canvas
- Skyscrapers, sidewalks, crosswalks, roads
- Stadium with field and stands
- House with roof, window, and door
- Fully drawn 2D city scene

**Requirements**
  -Python 3
  -cs1graphics library

Install using:
  pip install cs1graphics

**How to Run**
-Install Python and cs1graphics.
-Download the project file.

Run it using:
  -python project.py
  -A graphical window will appear showing the animated city.

**Purpose of the Project**
  -Practice working with shapes, layers, and animations
  -Understand coordinate systems and object movement
  -Explore simple simulation concepts
  -Improve Python coding and creativity
  
**Future Improvements**
  -Add keyboard controls for the helicopter or cars
  -Add collision detection
  -Add pedestrians or more buildings
  -Add random traffic behavior
